# orderingapp

Hi there,

This is my second mobile app. It is a complex ordering app. After downloading it, the signed-in client can order disposable items (p.es. paper cup, plastic knife). Since the API url is confidental and the app structure is made to receive and use incoming JSON objects, this code won't work. It just serves to present how I build up an application from the beginning.

As you can see, variable names are often in Hungarian. I don't prefer this bilingual mixture, but incoming object properties were partly in Hungarian, and I did not want any naming issue.
